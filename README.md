# Birder
Birder is a social network-style platform for logging, sharing, and analysing bird observations. Ultimately, the aim is to feed the data to an algorithm which will help with species identification. 

## *** Major refactor in progress ***
### The server and client software are being moved into separate projects.
The new client respository is [birder-client](https://github.com/WinthorpeCross/birder-client).
This repsoitory will now contain only the server project.

### Technical information

Birder is an Angular 13 single-page application served by an ASP.NET 6 REST API.

#### Sample data

T-SQL scripts for adding sample data to the database are available by request.
